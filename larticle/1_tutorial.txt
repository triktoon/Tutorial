<{Proposal};
   'The site's proposal consists of using GitHub services to create repositories with a specific FOLDER STRUCTURE together with text files in a specific text syntax to generate COMPONENTS and create a new type of content called larticle.';
   <{Prerequisites};
      'You will need to have git installed on your computer, have a Github account and know the basic commands to manipulate git repositories.';
      'You will need an IDE (Integrated Development Environment), which offers a good text editing interface that integrates well with git and Github. ex: VSCode';

<{Components};
   'It is possible to create components like this:';

   (l){Example}'{title}'text'[black;white;solid red](l)##1';

   {title}'text'[black; white; solid red](l);

   'Components are ALWAYS separated by semicolons "##1".';
   
   'if you want to use semicolons in the text or title, enter "#,#,1" without the commas';

   'Whatever comes inside braces {} will make the title.';

   'Whatever comes inside SINGLE quotation marks '' will make up the text.';

   'It is not necessary to have both, it can just be title:';

   (l){Example}'{title}[ black; white; solid red]##1';

   {title}[ black; white; solid red];

   'Or just text:';

   (l){Example}''text'[ black; white; solid red]##1';

   'text'[black; white; solid red];

   'Whatever comes inside parentheses () will define the side:';

   (l){Example}''text'[ black; white; solid red](e)##1';

   'text'[black; white; solid red](e);

   'Or:';

   (l){Example}''text'[ black; white; solid red](d)##1';

   'text'[black; white; solid red](d);

   '(l)(left), (right)(r) || (e)(d).';

   'The brackets are used to define colors and styles.
   First, the background color of the component is defined, then the text color and finally the border, separated by a semicolon "##1":';

   (l){Example}'{example}[red; yellow; solid green 3px]##1';

   {example}[red; yellow; solid green 3px];

   'It is also possible to reuse styles by saving them in a title, just start the component with an exclamation mark "!":';

   (l){Example}'![blue;#fa5]{reusing style}##1';

   ![blue;#fa5]{reusing style};

   'Nothing will be displayed, but now whenever you use the title"{reusing style}" it will have this styling:';

   (l){Example}''example text'{reusing style}##1';

   'example text'{reusing style};

   'The styles registered in the titles are valid only in the chapter in which they were declared.';

   'Styles marked directly in the component override title styles.';

   'It is also possible to create 'sections' that can contain other components inside, to do this you must open the section with "<##1" and close with ">##1". can be styled normally and can contain title :';

   (l){Example}'
      <{Section title}[yellow;#f5e]##1
         {section}(d)##1
         {...}##1
         {example}(e)##1
      >##1';

   <{Section title}[yellow;#f5e];
      {section}(d);
      {...};
      {example}(e);
   >;

   'Sections can also contain sections:';

   (l){Example}'
      <{Section title}[yellow;#f5e]##1
         <{reusing style}##1
            {example}(e)'section within a section'##1
         >##1
      >##1';

   <{Section title}[yellow;#f5e];
   <{reusing style};
   {example}(e)'section within a section';
   >;
   >;

   'Always remember to close the sections WITH ">##1".';

   'It is also possible to insert media, first the media needs to be available online, after that, just start the component with "@" and use
   embed(iframe) or
   img (image link) or
   video(video link).';

   (l){Example}
   '
   @img(image link)##1
   @video(video link)##1
   @embed(iframe)##1';

   'This type of component has no text, style or title, but can have the side defined if the parentheses come before.';

   (l){Example}
   '
   @(e)img(image link)##1
   @(d)video(video link)##1
   @(e)embed(iframe)##1';

   'And lastly, so that an inserted component is not rendered, simply place an asterisk "*" at the beginning, this avoids the need to delete them.';

   (l){Example}'*'text'{title}##1';

<{Repository folder structure};
   'The main branch will always be used';

   'The repository must contain a folder called larticle in its root, which will be used to render the content.'{larticle};

   'Each chapter corresponds to a text file with the extension ".txt", the file name is the name of the chapter.';

   'Chapters can be grouped by folders, the name of the grouping is the name of the folder.';

   'If the file name is "_styles.txt" or "_estilos.txt" it will not be displayed, but it may contain styles that persisted across all pages.';

   'We recommend creating a file "autor.txt" or "author.txt" that contains your contacts, social networks and forms of support';
 
   'if your larticle is not available in the catalog go to "https://www.larticle.com/github-profile-name/repository-name"';

   'Disclose your larticle link on your social media.';

   'Your article can be updated at any time, just update the repository and repost';

<{Final considerations};

   'In advance, I to thank those who decided to develop their larticle and especially those who decided to support the project, each donation, makes this project possible.';
