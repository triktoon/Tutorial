        'a while later, walking through the forest they see a house'|

        (r){John}'this is not our house, Maria!'|
        (l){Maria}'I know, I found someone to ask for help'|

        {John}'at least it's warm in here'(e)|
        {Maria}'like I said, it's a good place to spend the night,
        let's go to sleep and tomorrow we'll wake up early to try to get back home'(e)|
        'they went to sleep when in the middle of the night John wakes up'|
        {John}'Maria, Maria... wake up'(e)|
        {Maria}'John goes to sleep!'(e)|
        {John}'seriously, there are some strange things'(e)|
        {Maria}'there's nothing strange, you're fearful, it must be all in your head'(e)|
        {John}'I don't remember going to sleep here'(e)|
        {Maria}'we got lost in the forest, remember?'(e)|
        {John}'Maria wake up!! look where we are'(e)|
        'Maria gets up, opens her eyes and realizes that she was no longer where she had gone to sleep'|
        {Maria} 'Hey, how did we end up here?'(e)|
        {John}'I said there was something strange!'(e)|
        'they hear a woman's voice that seemed to come from the ceiling'|
        {John}'Maria, I think I better get out of here'(e)|
        {Maria}'calm down! It must just be the owner of the abandoned house wanting to help'(e)|
        {John}'how are you sure?'(e)|
        {Maria}'What else could it be? come, let's go and see her so you can see that you don't need to be afraid'(e)|
        {John}'no need, I want to stay here'(e)|
        {Maria} 'come on, I'm hungry, she must have something for us to eat'(e)|
        'the two meet, go up the stairs and as they get closer to where they hear the voice
        they see an old woman surrounded by strange creatures,
        she feeds a rabbit on her lap that immediately turns into one of the creatures after eating'|
        {Witch}'fantastic, another beautiful addition to my army of creatures!
        At dawn I'll find out what those two little brats will turn into'(d)|
        'Maria covered John's mouth, preventing him from screaming and slowly walked away without making any noise'|
        {John}'do you still want to order food?'(e)|
        {Maria} 'Okay, you were right, I think we better get out of here, but without making noise!!
         if she hears us she won't let us leave'(e)|
        'they leave the house through the window, and see a carriage'|
        {Maria}'it must be the old woman's carriage, get in there'(e)|
        {John}'Do you know how to drive this?'(e)|
        {Maria}'come up soon!'(e)|
        {John}'ugh...ok'(e)|
        {Maria}'now just hit the horses with a whip and they'll walk, but... where's the whip?'(e)|
        {John}'it must be here, but it won't make any noise when they...'(e)|
        'Maria strikes the horses that stand up frightened and neighing loudly,
        the door of the house opens abruptly'|
        {Witch}'what's going on here?'(d)|
        {John}'MARIA, FAST!!'(e)|
        'Maria desperately hits the horses, and they take off running'|
        {Witch} 'where do these brats think they're going?'(d)|
        'the Witch takes 3 wolf-shaped amulets hanging around her neck and throws them to the ground,
        they transform into gigantic wolves'|
        {Witch}'CATCH THEM!!'(d)|

    <{Forest}|
        {Maria}'I think we managed to escape'(d)|
        {John} 'ahh... Maria, there's something behind us' (e)|
        'they hear a howl, footsteps, growls and barks.
        John looks out of the carriage window and sees the wolves behind him'|
        {John}'Maria are the wolves, they are reaching us'(e)|
        {Maria}' hold on! I'll try to speed it up'(d)|
        {John}'they're too close'(e)|
        {Maria}'I saw an arch and it was inside! try to shoot them'(d)|
        {John}'I don't know how to use this'(e)|
        {Maria}'TRY!'(d)|
        'John tries to shoot the wolves and misses repeatedly.
        the carriage shook during the race and caused one of the amulets inside to fall out the window
        John saw the amulet transform into a small stone golem that delayed one of the wolves.
        he noticed that there were several of these amulets in there...'|
        {Maria}'did you manage to get anything right?'(d)|
        {John}'no, but I think I know how to stop them'(e)|
        'John takes the amulets and throws them along the path, they transform and attack the wolves'|
        {Maria}'how did you do that?'(d)|
        {John}'these things transform into these creatures'(e)|
        {Maria} 'how did you make them attack the wolves?'(d)|
        {John}'I don't know, they attack the first thing they see'(e)|
        {Maria}'whatever it is, we're safe!!'(d)|
